# SeeFood: AI food detection website

SeeFood uses AI API to detect the food in the picture, and gives you a list of food type and its probability.

This project is built with React, Node.js, PostgreSQL to practice my full-stack programming skills.
The files includes both the front and back end.

In the project directory, you can run:### `npm start`to run the front end page.
In the server directory, you can run:### `npm start`to run the back end server.

### Demo page (with only front end)
